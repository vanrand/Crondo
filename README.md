Crondo
======

Task running framework w/ time and event-based scheduling


### Idea

This is an idea to implement an open-sourced version of the internal "CronRunner" 
project/module as a new Perl module named ```Crondo```. This would be a generic
class/package name which could work via simple cmd-line scripts but would also 
have Catalyst, Plack, etc interfaces as well. (The existing "CronRunner" 
implementation is a Catalyst Controller which uses a Catalyst DBIC model for
persistence). 

More explanations TBD...
